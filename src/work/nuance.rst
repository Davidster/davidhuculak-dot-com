Nuance
======

In 2016, I joined `Nuance Communications <https://www.nuance.com>`_ as an intern.
I ended up staying there till the end of the year, and then returning once again
for the last four months of 2017. During my time there, I worked on a few different projects such as:

Script Runner
-------------

When I first started at Nuance, I was tasked with an experimental project.
One of their intenal systems consisted of a visual tool that allowed technicians
to build decision trees which chatbots or automated IVR systems would use
to interact with end customers. I added a hook system where an arbitrary script
written in JavaScript could be run in the event that a given node in the
decision tree was reached.

Site Theme Update
-----------------

Around the same time that I first joined the company, Nuance had recently
gone through a re-branding, meaning that they needed to update many of
their tools accordingly. As it happened, this update was required  for one of
the web apps that was being maintained by my team. I ended up working
with one of the web designers in the company in order to update the branding of
the site and enhance some of the outdated UI elements. This was a good way
for me to learn CSS as well as a less well-known framework called `GWT <http://www.gwtproject.org/>`_
in which Java code is compiled into JavaScript to run in the browser.

Demo Builder
------------

My team at Nuance maintained a tool which allowed technicians to quickly
build custom-branded demo versions of one of their apps, so they could
show potential customers what the app might look like with their own
colors / logos. To this demo system, I added some additional configuration
properties that could be used to further customize the demo UI, and I
added a Google OAuth integration to make it easy authorize specific individuals
to access the system. While the site was only hosted in the company's private 
network, anyone with the link was able to access it before I added this feature.
