CHK PLZ / sunday
================

`CHK PLZ <https://hq.chkplzapp.com/>`_ is a startup company I joined in December of 2019. Their core business consists
of an application that lets you pay for your bill at the end of the evening at a restaurant
or bar, saving you time and easing the load on the waitstaff. When I first joined, the 
company was small and the tech team was even smaller, making it the most intense
and rewarding job I've had.

In Q3 of 2021, CHK PLZ was acquired by `sunday <https://sundayapp.com/>`_, a young European company
that shares our vision which is where I'm currently working.
